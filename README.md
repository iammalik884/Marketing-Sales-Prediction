# Marketing Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a simple yet effective machine learning model that predicts **sales** based on **marketing spend** across various platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The Linear Regression algorithm is used to find meaningful relationships between ad spend and resulting sales.

## Objective
To help marketing teams make **data-driven decisions** by:
- Understanding which platform gives better return on investment
- Forecasting future sales based on planned budget
- Reducing guesswork and improving campaign performance

## Dataset
A simple CSV file with the following columns:
- **TV**: Budget spent on TV ads
- **Radio**: Budget spent on Radio ads
- **Newspaper**: Budget spent on Newspaper ads
- **Sales**: Sales generated

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)

## Project Files
- `marketing_sales_model.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all code and analysis
- `data.csv` – Dataset used for training/testing the model

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `marketing_sales_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells
4. Modify input values to test predictions

## Results
The model was able to:
- Identify TV as the strongest predictor of sales
- Fit a regression line with good accuracy
- Predict sales with minimal error
